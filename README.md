# US-Recession-Prediction
With the COVID-19 situation continuing to escalate, more and more countries have issued “lock-down” orders. A slew of data showed just how much the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns to curb the spread of disease have damaged the US economy. While such drastic order is necessary for mitigating the virus, this has also imposed serious concerns for the world’s economy, making investors concerned about a potential recession. Many economic indicators released recently posted record slumps, fell to lows not seen in years or decades, or surpassed data from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Our research will explore questions about recession forecasting and try to see if a recession is coming via analyzing several economic indicators related with job, bond rate, consumer behavior etc. We wish to analyze economic indicators, predict the probability of recession happening in 2020, make a comparison of this recession with the Great Recession of 2007-2009, and to predict several indicators’ development tendency. As a result, we found out that there is a high probability of economic recession occurs in the near future.
